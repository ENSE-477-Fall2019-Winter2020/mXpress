# Scripts

## extract_here
extracts a csv file from the sample here data. The filename should be the path to Streets.shp, without the '.shp' extension. This program joins the contents of .shp and .dbf to produce the output.

# Todo
A program similar to routemapper, using an osrm instance to map the from/to csv produced by extract_here to a map of sensor id to osm segments. This program will also have to duplicate the csv records to run in both directions.
